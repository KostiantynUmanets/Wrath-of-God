# C Project Makefile Documentation

This document explains the Makefile used for compiling C projects. It details the purpose of each instruction, provides links to relevant documentation for further reading, and includes guidance on how to use the `make` command.

## Overview

The Makefile compiles C source files located in the `src/` directory, applying strict compilation flags, and outputs the executable to the `build/` directory. It also includes a check for the GCC compiler version.

## How to Use the Make Command

To use this Makefile, you need to have GNU Make installed on your system. The `make` command is used to control the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

### Basic Commands

- **Building the Project**: 
  - Run `make` or `make all` to build the entire project. This will check the GCC version, compile the source files, and generate the executable in the `build` directory.
- **Cleaning Up**: 
  - Run `make clean` to remove all files generated by the build process, cleaning up the project directory.
- **Checking GCC Version**:
  - Run `make check-gcc-version` to check if GCC is installed and to print its version. 

### Note

- If you modify a source file, simply running `make` again will recompile only that file and any files dependent on it, thanks to the dependency tracking in the Makefile.
- Always run `make clean` before a full project rebuild to ensure all old files are removed.

## Compiler and Flags

- **Compiler**: `gcc`
  - GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, is a standard compiler for C.
  - [GCC Documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/)
- **Flags**: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
  - These flags enable additional warnings and treat all warnings as errors.

### Directories

- **Source Directory**: `src`
  - Contains the .c source files.
- **Build Directory**: `build`
  - The directory where object files and the final executable are placed.

### Files and Targets

- **SOURCES**: List of .c files in the `src` directory.
  - Uses the `wildcard` function.
  - [GNU Make Wildcard Function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Wildcard-Function.html)
- **OBJECTS**: Corresponding .o files for each .c file.
  - Uses `patsubst` for string substitution.
  - [GNU Make Patsubst Function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)
- **TARGET**: The final executable file.

### Rules

- **all**: The default target.
  - First checks the GCC version, then builds the target executable.
- **check-gcc-version**: Checks if GCC is installed and its version.
  - Uses shell commands within a Makefile.
  - [Using Shell Commands in Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Shell-Function.html)
- **$(TARGET)**: Compiles the object files into the final executable.
- **$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o**: Compiles each .c file into an .o file.
  - Includes automatic directory creation for the build folder.
- **clean**: Removes the `build/` directory and its contents.

### Special Targets

- **.PHONY**: Indicates targets that do not correspond to files.
  - Ensures that these targets are always executed when requested.
